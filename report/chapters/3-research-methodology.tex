\chapter{Research Methodology}


\section{Data Preparation}

We obtained our dataset from Motional AD Inc's publicly available nuScenes dataset version 1.0-mini. This dataset consists of 10 different scenes,
each approximately 20 seconds long, with annotated data provided every half a second (2 Hz).

Next, we used nuScenes devkit package in Python. This package provides a suite of tools to 
easily query and retrieve data from the nuScenes dataset. Only the front-facing camera channel (CAM\_FRONT) was utilized
with 14 classes. These classes are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item drivable area
    \item ped crossing
    \item walkway
    \item carpark
    \item car
    \item truck
    \item bus
    \item trailer
    \item construction vehicle
    \item pedestrian
    \item motorcycle
    \item bicycle
    \item traffic cone
    \item barrier
\end{itemize}
