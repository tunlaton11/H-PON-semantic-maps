\section{Paragraph}

\begin{itemize}
  \item In general, one line per one paragraph.
  \item Use \verb|\\ (double backslash)| to break new line in the same paragraph.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example:}

We approach instantaneous mapping, converting images to a top-down view of the world, as a translation problem. \verb|\\|We show how a novel form of transformer network can be used to map from images and video directly to an overhead map or bird's-eye-view (BEV) of the world, in a single end-to-end network.

\emph{will be rendered like this:}
