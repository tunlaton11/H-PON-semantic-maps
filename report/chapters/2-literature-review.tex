\section{Autonomous Driving}

A vehicle is considered to be autonomous when it is capable of driving by itself without human supervision. \cite{Springer_AutonomousDriving} The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) defines 6 levels of driving automation, ranging from no driving automation (level 0) to full driving automation (level 5)\cite{SAE_AutomationLevels}, which are described in table \ref{tab:sae-driving-automation}.


\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{p{4cm}|X}
\textbf{Level} & \textbf{Description} \\
\hline
Level 0: No Driving Automation & 
A driver is fully responsible for driving task. The vehicle may provide driving assistance feature e.g. warnings and alerts.\\ 
\hline
Level 1: Driver Assistance &
A driver is responsible for driving task. The driving automation system provide continuous assistance with acceleration, braking, or steering.\\
\hline
Level 2: Partial Driving Automation &
A driver supervises driving task. The driving automation system provide continuous assistance with acceleration, braking, and steering.\\
\hline
Level 3: Conditional Driving Automation &
The driving automation system performs driving task, while a driver is required during a fallback.\\
\hline
Level 4: High Driving Automation &
The driving automation system performs driving task only within specific conditions or designated area.\\
\hline
Level 5: Full Driving Automation &
The driving automation system performs driving task unconditionally. There is no need for a driver.

\section{nuScenes Dataset}

The nuScenes dataset is a public dataset for autonomous driving developed by Motional AD Inc. It contains 1,000 driving scenes collected in Boston and Singapore. The full dataset includes approximately 1.4M camera images, 390k lidar (light detection and ranging) sweeps, 1.4M radar sweeps and 1.4M object bounding boxes in 40k keyframes with annotation of 23 object classes. The goal of dataset developer team is to allow researchers across the world to develop safe autonomous driving technology. \cite{nuscenes2019}
