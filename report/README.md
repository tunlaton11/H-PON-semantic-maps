# Report for Translating Images into Maps for Autonomous Driving Using Deep Learning

LaTex files for project report.

# Requirements

Tex distribution, e.g. MiTeX, is required to render the report. However, general text editor can be used to edit .tex file.

# Recommendation

If you have no idea about LaTex, follow the following steps.
1. Install [MikTex](https://miktex.org/) as Tex distribution. MikTex comes with TeXworks as LaTex editor
2. (Optional) Install [Texmaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) for using as LaTex editor. Or any other alternatives.
3. Edit `.tex` file with LaTex editor.
4. To render the report, run `main.tex` in LaTex editor.
5. Finish the report by due date. ðŸ”¥
